    "   - **Impact of geographical features:** How do geographical features, such as proximity to water, affect the sales price of a house? \n",
    "   - **Impact of zip code:** How much does zip code affect the sales price of the homes within it?\n",
    "   - **Quantifying Relative Location:** How can the distance from K-Means clusters be used to predict sales price?\n",

The sale price, age, coordinates, square footage, floors, and number of rooms were contained within this dataset. The data we mainly utilized was how much the homes sold for, the coordinates of each home, and the square footage of the livingspace."
